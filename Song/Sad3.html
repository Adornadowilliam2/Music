    <p><b>[Intro]</b>
    <br>
    Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you</p>
    
    <p><b>[Verse 1]</b>
    <br>
    Holdin' me back
    Gravity's holdin' me back
    I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
    Why don't we leave it at that?
    Nothin' to say
    When everything gets in the way
    Seems you cannot be replaced
    And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh</p>
   
    <p><b>[Chorus]</b>
    <br>
    In this world, it's just us
    You know it's not the same as it was
    In this world, it's just us
    You know it's not the same as it was
    As it was, as it was
    You know it's not the same</p>
    
    <p><b>[Verse 2]</b>
    <br>
    Answer the phone
    "Harry, you're no good alone
    Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
    What kind of pills are you on?"
    Ringin' the bell
    And nobody's coming to help
    Your daddy lives by himself
    He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh</p>
   
    <p><b>[Chorus]</b>
    <br>
    In this world, it's just us
    You know it's not the same as it was
    In this world, it's just us
    You know it's not the same as it was
    As it was, as it was
    You know it's not the same</p>
  
    <p><b>[Bridge]</b>
    <br>
    Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
    I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
    Leave America, two kids follow her
    I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first</p>
   
    <p><b>[Outro]</b>
    <br>
    (Hey)
    As it was
    You know it's not the same as it was
    As it was, as it was</p>
